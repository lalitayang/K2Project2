## About

It’s football season!! With the 2018 season set to begin on September 6, 2018, I’m interested in looking at the public records of police arrests at NFL stadiums. Can stadium staff know when they need to request more police? Do states with higher alcohol consumption per capita (aged over 21) suggest a higher number of arrests?
